            <h1>CUSTOM BUILDS</h1>
            <p>At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing superior customer service and satisfaction. Our staff will assist you every step of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds.
                We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, and we've seen some ups and downs, we're loving every moment of it. A proper custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right.
                From stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all. Talk with a member of our mechanics team to discuss your plan, and we'll see your dream realized.</p>

            <p>All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.</p>

          <p>Wear your mask: Please wear a mask properly at all times when visiting the store, and limit your visit to 10 minutes or less.<br>
          Flat changes: Done same day! But plan to drop off your bike and come back later.<br>
          Payments: there is a terminal at the window with card & contactless payment options.<br>
          Tune-ups, repairs, and service: we have a waitlist, so call or email to get on it.<br>
          While we’re sad that we can’t be the same face-to-face, high-fiving resource we usually are, we appreciate your patience and understanding as we do our best to continue our mission of getting as many folks on bikes as possible.</p>
